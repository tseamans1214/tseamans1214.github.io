  	<p>"A personal note:  We had Floors N' More put down the tile in our front bedroom, and hall down to the master bedroom door. Jared, the installer did a fantastic job for us.  He was polite, on time, and cleaned up when he was through.  I highly recommend Jared and Floors 'N More.  Last week we had carpet installed in the living room and dinning room.  Again, we had Floors 'N More do the work for us and they did a super job..." </p>

  	<p>"To all the wonderful people at Floors N' More: Just a short note to thank all the wonderful employees of Floors N'More for a great job, as we look around we cannot believe how beautiful, the floors, and counter tops came out.  We are so proud of them.  You did exactly as you promised moved what had to be moved, did what work had to be done, moved everything back and cleaned up.  All the work that was done was beyond our expectations, the crew of employees that spent a week at our home, were very professional, polite, hard working and dedicated to their profession.
